# ProjectsTimeTracker

This project is a website that tracks the development of projects. I have used Javascript, HTML and CSS to build this website.

I got hands on experience working with APIs to exchange data between clients and Server in this project.

I developed features like tracking time spent by developer on each project and creating a detailed review report accordingly by the information collected from tracking. It also displays reports and projects designate to a person or a Project.
